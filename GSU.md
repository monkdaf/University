## GEORGIA STATE PAYMENT PLAN [link](https://sfs.gsu.edu/resources/tuition/how-to-pay/georgia-state-payment-plan/)

Georgia State Payment Plan allows a student to defer payment of the current termâ€™s tuition and mandatory fees. Meal plans and parking charges are not eligible to be deferred as part of the payment plan. The deferred balance is calculated after all estimated financial aid is applied to the student account. Financial aid is defined as any estimated or actual aid, third-party and scholarship payments, and waivers (tuition, fee, etc.).

Upon Enrollment in the plan, a __*$50 non-refundable enrollment fee*__ is assessed to offset administrative costs.  Students must agree to make any scheduled deferred payment(s) via automatic deduction from their bank account or credit card during the enrollment process. Failure to make the installment(s) as agreed will result in withdrawal from Georgia State and you may be ineligible to enroll in the payment plan for subsequent semesters.

- ### How do I enroll?
>Sign-up is done through PantherPay via PAWS.
>
>Before enrolling in the payment plan, you need to complete your registration and ensure that all elective charges such as housing, meal plans, parking, etc. are on your student account. Doing this ensures you will only need to make one down payment and this allows you to defer the maximum amount. When you are ready to enroll in the Georgia State Payment Plan or want to determine how much you may defer under the plan based on your current account status, please follow the [GSU Payment Plan Enrollment instructions](https://sfs.gsu.edu/files/2020/07/GSU-Payment-Plan-Enrollment-instructions_07222020.pdf).
