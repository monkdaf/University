Payment is due in full by the date indicated on your eBill. Paying your eBill is the last step in the enrollment confirmation process for each semester. Failure to pay tuition and fees by the deadline could result in both financial and academic consequences.

## GEORGIA STATE PAYMENT PLAN [link](https://sfs.gsu.edu/resources/tuition/how-to-pay/georgia-state-payment-plan/)

>he Georgia State Payment Plan allows a student to defer payment of the current termâ€™s tuition and mandatory fees. Meal plans and parking charges are not eligible to be deferred as part of the payment plan. The deferred balance is calculated after all estimated financial aid is applied to the student account. Financial aid is defined as any estimated or actual aid, third-party and scholarship payments, and waivers (tuition, fee, etc.).

>Upon Enrollment in the plan, a $50 non-refundable enrollment fee is assessed to offset administrative costs.  Students must agree to make any scheduled deferred payment(s) via automatic deduction from their bank account or credit card during the enrollment process. Failure to make the installment(s) as agreed will result in withdrawal from Georgia State and you may be ineligible to enroll in the payment plan for subsequent semesters.
