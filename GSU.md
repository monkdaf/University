## When do I pay tuition and fees? [link](https://gsu.my.site.com/support/s/article/When-do-I-pay-tuition-and-fees)

>Your eBill for tuition, fees and housing charges will be posted online in July for the fall semester, December for the spring semester and April for the summer semester. Payment is due in full by the date indicated on your eBill. Paying your eBill is the last step in the enrollment confirmation process for each semester. Failure to pay tuition and fees by the deadline could result in both financial and academic consequences.
